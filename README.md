- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CJ-Patel
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in always learning and honing my skills, Iâ€™m currently completing a course to become a Full-Stack Web Developer
- ðŸŒ± This is a step up from having completed a course of Software Engineering through HyperionDev, where I worked on various projects in Python, Java and other languages. The course covered the Introduction to Programming, Introduction to Software, Data Science & Algorithms. Will be uploading those projects as well on my new portfolio site. (Currently those projects are available on another profile - @CJPatel108 - if you are interested in viewing my work completed through HyperionDev).
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new and exciting projects.
- ðŸ“« Please find me through my contact details and do not hesitate to reach out

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently working on a portfolio which will be featuring most of the projects that I've worked on whilst on my journey to become Full-Stack Web Developer
